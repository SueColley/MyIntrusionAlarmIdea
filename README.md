# MyIntrusionAlarmIdea

Intrusion Detection Alarm - Detects When Someone OTHER Than I Enter And Speaks Scary Warning!!

Here's my initial take on the logic (I'll figure out how to format this correctly later) -- Ideas/Suggestions/Comments Welcome!!

Room Entry Warning System

#LOGIC
#Detect person entering room
	#Use Infrared Obstacle Avoidance Sensor
#Check to see if person is me
	#Use Bluetooth Sensor Module to Detect Whether My Fitbit is in Range
#If person is me
	#Do nothing
#Else
	#Take Picture
		#Send Message to Computer to Turn on and Take Pic
	#Play Warning
		#Play Appropriate Scary Message and Music
	#Notify Me
		#Send Text and Pic to My Phone

#Reset after 1 minute

	#Many thanks to eskimo for suggesting the code beautifier (so it's not too embarrassing to share my project now!) 
	#and to wireglitch for the V2.0 idea so I can track repeat offenders!!  
	#And of course, many thanks to tallhouse as well, for posting the project that started the conversation leading 
	#to these improvements in the first place!!  :-)

	#V2.0 should have a module to detect repeat bluetooth device id's and see who comes and goes as well. Just a thought.
